Basic Setup
===========

Step 1: Obtain Twitter API Keys
-------------------------------
* Have an account on `Twitter`_ for your app to tweet on.
* Obtain access keys to your account from `dev.twitter.com`_

    * Consumer keys from https://dev.twitter.com/apps (under "OAuth settings")
    * Access tokens from https://dev.twitter.com/apps (under "Your access token")

.. _Twitter: https://twitter.com

.. _dev.twitter.com: https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens

Step 2: Deploy to Heroku
------------------------

Press the button!

|Deploy|

You will need to create an account if you don't have one already.
Have your Consumer key/secret and Access token/secret from above handy.
You will also need to provide a name and email address to serve as an admin for the app.

After deploying, you will need to follow up with a few commands using
the `Heroku Toolbelt`_:

.. code:: sh

    heroku run --app YOURAPPNAME python manage.py createsuperuser
    heroku addons:open scheduler --app YOURAPPNAME

Replace YOURAPPNAME above with your app name from Heroku.

This will open a page titled **Schedule recurring tasks for your app**.
Click ``Add new job`` and paste the following in next to the ``$`` symbol:

.. code:: sh

    python manage.py tweet_next

You will also choose the frequency of posting here (``Daily``, ``Hourly``, or ``every 10 minutes``).
If you need more granularity over the posting interval, see the advanced instructions below.

You are now ready to open your app and start adding tweets.
You can access your app at ``yourappname.herokuapp.com`` or by running this command back in the prompt from earlier:

.. code:: sh

    heroku open --app YOURAPPNAME

.. _Heroku Toolbelt: https://toolbelt.heroku.com/

Settings
--------

Moved to settings_.

.. _settings: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html

Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ py.test

Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moved to `Live reloading and SASS compilation`_.

.. _`Live reloading and SASS compilation`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html



Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd tweeter
    celery -A tweeter.taskapp worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.




Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``
