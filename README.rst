Basic Setup
===========

Step 1: Obtain Twitter API Keys
-------------------------------
* Have an account on `Twitter`_ for your app to tweet on.
* Obtain access keys to your account from `dev.twitter.com`_

    * Consumer keys from https://dev.twitter.com/apps (under "OAuth settings")
    * Access tokens from https://dev.twitter.com/apps (under "Your access token")

.. _Twitter: https://twitter.com

.. _dev.twitter.com: https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens

Step 2: Deploy to Heroku
------------------------

Press the button!

|Deploy|

You will need to create an account if you don't have one already. Have your Consumer key/secret and Access token/secret from above handy.

After deploying, you will need to follow up with a few commands using
the `Heroku Toolbelt`_:

.. code:: sh

    heroku run --app YOURAPPNAME python manage.py createsuperuser
    heroku open

Replace YOURAPPNAME above with your app name from Heroku.

Settings

Moved to settings_.

Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ py.test

Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moved to `Live reloading and SASS compilation`_.

.. _`Live reloading and SASS compilation`: http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html



Celery
^^^^^^

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd tweeter
    celery -A tweeter.taskapp worker -l info

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.




Email Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server `MailHog`_ with a web interface is available as docker container.

.. _mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check `cookiecutter-django Docker documentation`_ for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to ``http://127.0.0.1:8025``




Sentry
^^^^^^

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at  https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter  or download and host it yourself.
The system is setup with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.
